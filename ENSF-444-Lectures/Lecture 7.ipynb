    "### Lasso Regression\n",
    "- An alternative to Ridge for regularizing linear regression is Lasso\n",
    "- As with ridge regression, the lasso also restricts coefficients to be close to\n",
    "zero, but in a slightly different way, called L1 regularization\n",
    "- The 𝑙_1-norm of the w's is defined as:\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/L6/L6-5.png\" alt=\"L6-5.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "- The cost function to minimize becomes:\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/L6/L6-6.png\" alt=\"L6-6.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "- The consequence of L_1 regularization is that when using the lasso, some\n",
    "coefficients are exactly zero\n",
    "- This means some features are entirely ignored by the model\n",
    "- This can be seen as a form of automatic feature selection\n",
    "- Having some coefficients be exactly zero can make a model easier to\n",
    "interpret and can reveal the most important features of your model\n",
    "## Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- `The Mean Squared Error (MSE)` is a fundamental metric used to quantify the\n",
    "goodness of fit of a regression model by `measuring the average squared difference` \n",
    "between the `predicted values`, $\\hat{y}$, and the `actual values`, 𝒚, of the\n",
    "dependent variable. It provides a measure of how well the model’s predictions\n",
    "align with the observed data [Powers, 2011, Scott, 2010].\n",
